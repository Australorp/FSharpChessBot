# F# ChessBot

This is a program written to analyze and evaluate chess positions. 

As of right now, the evaluation function is not working, but the program can parse chess positions using [FEN notation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation), and it can generate most legal moves for each side (the program has no concept of [en passent captures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant) or [castling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling) yet).
